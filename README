DelayedJobMailer
==============

This plugin provides a module which - when included into an ActionMailer subclass - pushes all emails that would 
normally be delivered synchronously into a queue for asynchronous processing. For queuing it relies on the delayed_job 
plugin (http://github.com/tobi/delayed_job).

How it works
============

The plugin provides a module Delayed::AsynchMail. To make a mailer use a queue simply include it into the class like this:

class MyMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  include Delayed::AsynchMail
end

From now on all MyMailer.deliver_whatever_email calls create an entry delayed_job queue.
If you still want to deliver mail sycnhronously add a bang to the method call: MyMailer.deliver_whatever_email!

Installation
============

script/plugin install git://github.com/langalex/workling_mailer.git
